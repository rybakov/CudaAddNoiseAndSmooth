# Image Resizinf using NVIDIA NPP with CUDA

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of NVIDIA Performance Primitives (NPP) library with CUDA to perform image resizing. The goal is to utilize GPU acceleration to efficiently resize a given image by a scale, leveraging the computational power of modern GPUs. The project is a part of the CUDA at Scale for the Enterprise course and serves as a template for understanding how to implement basic image processing operations using CUDA and NPP.

## Code Organization

```bin/```
This folder should hold all binary/executable code that is built automatically or manually. Executable code should have use the .exe extension or programming language-specific extension.

```data/```
This folder should hold all example data in any format. If the original data is rather large or can be brought in via scripts, this can be left blank in the respository, so that it doesn't require major downloads when all that is desired is the code/structure.

```src/```
The source code should be placed here in a hierarchical fashion, as appropriate.

```README.md```
This file should hold the description of the project so that anyone cloning or deciding if they want to clone this repository can understand its purpose to help with their decision.

```INSTALL```
This file should hold the human-readable set of instructions for installing the code so that it can be executed. If possible it should be organized around different operating systems, so that it can be done by as many people as possible with different constraints.

```Makefile or CMAkeLists.txt or build.sh```
There should be some rudimentary scripts for building your project's code in an automatic fashion.

```run.sh```
An optional script used to run your executable code, either with or without command-line arguments.

## Supported OSes

Linux, Windows

## Supported CPU Architecture

x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l

## CUDA APIs involved

## Dependencies needed to build/run
[FreeImage](../../README.md#freeimage), [NPP](../../README.md#npp)

## Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 12.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.
Make sure the dependencies mentioned in [Dependencies]() section above are installed.

## Build and Run


### Linux
The Linux samples are built using makefiles. To use the makefiles, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run make:
```
$ cd CudaRescale
$ make all
```


## Running the Program
After building the project, you can run the program using the following command:

```bash
Copy code
make run
```

This command will execute the compiled binary, rotating the input image (Lena.png) by 45 degrees, and save the result as Lena_rotated.png in the data/ directory.

If you wish to run the binary directly with custom input/output files and custom scale, you can use:

```bash
- Copy code
./bin/resizeNPP --input data/lena.pgm --output data/lena_rescaled.pgm --scale=2
```

- Cleaning Up
To clean up the compiled binaries and other generated files, run:


```bash
- Copy code
make clean
```

This will remove all files in the bin/ directory.
